# Community Simulator User Guide

The Community Simulator is a powerful tool for demonstrating collaborative problem-solving with multiple cognitive
agents. This guide will help you understand how to use the simulator effectively.

## Overview

The Community Simulator allows you to:

- Deploy multiple cognitive agents with different roles and expertise
- Select from a variety of educational problems across different domains
- Simulate collaborative problem-solving sessions
- Observe how agents with their own cognitive contexts can work together

## Getting Started

1. Navigate to the "Community" view in the unified interface
2. Select a problem from the dropdown menu:
    - Medical Diagnosis Challenge
    - Environmental Impact Assessment
    - Strategic Business Decision
    - Cybersecurity Threat Analysis
    - Scientific Hypothesis Testing
3. Deploy agent participants by entering names and clicking "Add Participant"
4. Click "Start Simulation" to begin the collaborative session

## Agent Deployment

Each agent you deploy has:

- A unique name
- A randomly assigned role (e.g., Medical Doctor, Environmental Scientist)
- Specific expertise in a domain area
- Its own cognitive context with beliefs, goals, and attention mechanisms

Agents can be removed at any time during the simulation.

## Simulation Features

- **Autonomous Agent Actions**: Agents will automatically contribute to the discussion every few seconds
- **Human Participation**: You can submit your own inputs to the collaboration feed
- **Cognitive System Responses**: The system will process inputs and provide responses
- **Real-time Feed**: All interactions are displayed in a real-time collaboration feed

## Educational Value

The Community Simulator demonstrates:

- Peer-to-peer collaboration between cognitive agents
- How different expertise areas can contribute to problem-solving
- The integration of the cognitive system in collaborative contexts
- The potential for multi-agent reasoning systems in real-world applications

## Problem Domains

The simulator includes problems from:

- Healthcare and Medicine
- Environmental Science
- Business Strategy
- Cybersecurity
- Scientific Research

Each problem is designed to showcase different aspects of the cognitive system's reasoning capabilities.
