# Senars3 Cognitive System - Non-Axiomatic Logic Core Principles

## Overview

The Senars3 cognitive system implements a next-generation agentic reasoning framework based on Non-Axiomatic Logic (NAL) principles. This approach fundamentally differs from traditional symbolic AI systems by replacing fixed axioms with experience-grounded reasoning, enabling the system to handle uncertainty, learn from incomplete information, and adapt its knowledge base through interaction with its environment.

## Non-Axiomatic Logic Principles

### 1. Experience-Grounded Reasoning

Unlike classical logic systems that rely on fixed axioms, NAL grounds all reasoning in experience. Every conclusion is derived from observations and interactions rather than predetermined rules. This allows the system to:

- Adapt to new domains without reprogramming
- Handle incomplete or contradictory information gracefully
- Learn from both positive and negative examples
- Continuously refine its understanding through experience

### 2. Uncertainty Management

All knowledge in the system carries explicit uncertainty measures through truth values:

- **Frequency (f)**: The relative frequency of evidence supporting a statement (0.0 to 1.0)
- **Confidence (c)**: The amount of evidence available (0.0 to 1.0)

These values allow the system to:
- Distinguish between well-supported beliefs and tentative hypotheses
- Make decisions based on available evidence even when incomplete
- Update beliefs as new evidence becomes available
- Reason about the reliability of its own conclusions

### 3. Goal-Directed Cognition

All cognitive processes are driven by goals, which are represented as special types of cognitive items with attention values:

- **Priority (p)**: The current importance of pursuing the goal (0.0 to 1.0)
- **Durability (d)**: How long the goal remains important (0.0 to 1.0)

This enables the system to:
- Focus computational resources on high-priority tasks
- Balance immediate needs with long-term objectives
- Adapt goal priorities based on changing circumstances
- Maintain coherent behavior across extended reasoning sessions

### 4. Self-Reflective Operation

The system continuously monitors its own performance and adapts its reasoning processes:

- **Attention Mechanisms**: Dynamically allocate processing resources based on relevance
- **Resonance Processes**: Identify and strengthen coherent knowledge structures
- **Belief Revision**: Update knowledge based on new evidence and internal consistency
- **Schema Evolution**: Adapt reasoning patterns based on effectiveness

## Core Data Model

### SemanticAtom

The fundamental unit of knowledge representation:

```typescript
interface SemanticAtom {
  id: string;                // Unique identifier
  content: string;           // Natural language content
  embedding: number[];       // Semantic vector representation
  creationTime: number;      // Timestamp of creation
  lastAccessTime: number;    // Timestamp of last access
}
```

### CognitiveItem

Contextualized thoughts with associated values:

```typescript
interface CognitiveItem {
  id: string;                // Unique identifier
  type: 'BELIEF' | 'GOAL' | 'QUERY'; // Item category
  label: string;             // Natural language representation
  truth?: TruthValue;        // Truth value for beliefs
  attention?: AttentionValue; // Attention value for goals
  meta?: Record<string, any>; // Metadata (domain, source, etc.)
}

interface TruthValue {
  frequency: number;         // Evidence frequency (0.0 to 1.0)
  confidence: number;        // Evidence amount (0.0 to 1.0)
}

interface AttentionValue {
  priority: number;          // Current importance (0.0 to 1.0)
  durability: number;        // Persistence of importance (0.0 to 1.0)
}
```

## Cognitive Architecture

### 1. Agenda System

The central cognitive queue that prioritizes processing tasks:

- **Priority-based Scheduling**: Items are processed based on their attention values
