## Overview

The Senars3 cognitive system implements a next-generation agentic reasoning framework based on Non-Axiomatic Logic (NAL)
principles. This approach fundamentally differs from traditional symbolic AI systems by replacing fixed axioms with
experience-grounded reasoning, enabling the system to handle uncertainty, learn from incomplete information, and adapt
its knowledge base through interaction with its environment.

The system combines symbolic reasoning with Language Model technology to create a system capable of learning,
adaptation, and self-improvement through interaction with its environment. It features:

- Experience-grounded reasoning instead of fixed axioms
- Explicit uncertainty management through truth values (frequency and confidence)
- Goal-directed cognition with attention mechanisms (priority and durability)
- Self-reflective operation and adaptation
- Unified interface with both CLI and Web UI access through a WebSocket backend

### Conceptual Overview

Senars3 is designed as a cognitive system that processes information through multiple interconnected components:

1. **Input Processing**: Natural language inputs are converted into cognitive items with uncertainty measures
2. **Agenda Management**: Items are prioritized based on their importance and urgency
3. **Reasoning Engine**: Applies reasoning schemas to generate new knowledge
4. **Learning Mechanisms**: Evolves its knowledge base through experience
5. **Output Generation**: Produces responses that account for uncertainty and confidence

The system operates through continuous cycles of perception, reasoning, and learning, with each component contributing
to the overall cognitive process.

## Non-Axiomatic Logic Principles

Senars3 is built on four foundational principles of Non-Axiomatic Logic that enable adaptive, uncertainty-aware
reasoning:

### 1. Experience-Grounded Reasoning

Unlike classical logic systems that rely on fixed axioms, NAL grounds all reasoning in experience. Every conclusion is
derived from observations and interactions rather than predetermined rules. This allows the system to:

- **Adapt to new domains** without reprogramming
- **Handle incomplete or contradictory information** gracefully
- **Learn from both positive and negative examples**
- **Continuously refine its understanding** through experience

### 2. Uncertainty Management

All knowledge in the system carries explicit uncertainty measures through truth values:

- **Frequency (f)**: The relative frequency of evidence supporting a statement (0.0 to 1.0)
- **Confidence (c)**: The amount of evidence available (0.0 to 1.0)

These values allow the system to:

- **Distinguish** between well-supported beliefs and tentative hypotheses
- **Make decisions** based on available evidence even when incomplete
- **Update beliefs** as new evidence becomes available
- **Reason about the reliability** of its own conclusions

### 3. Goal-Directed Cognition

All cognitive processes are driven by goals, which are represented as special types of cognitive items with attention
values:

- **Priority (p)**: The current importance of pursuing the goal (0.0 to 1.0)
- **Durability (d)**: How long the goal remains important (0.0 to 1.0)

This enables the system to:

- **Focus computational resources** on high-priority tasks
- **Balance immediate needs** with long-term objectives
- **Adapt goal priorities** based on changing circumstances
- **Maintain coherent behavior** across extended reasoning sessions

### 4. Self-Reflective Operation

The system continuously monitors its own performance and adapts its reasoning processes:

- **Attention Mechanisms**: Dynamically allocate processing resources based on relevance
- **Resonance Processes**: Identify and strengthen coherent knowledge structures
- **Belief Revision**: Update knowledge based on new evidence and internal consistency
- **Schema Evolution**: Adapt reasoning patterns based on effectiveness

## Core Data Model

The Senars3 system uses two primary data structures to represent knowledge and cognitive states:

### SemanticAtom

The fundamental unit of knowledge representation that combines natural language content with semantic embeddings:

```typescript
interface SemanticAtom {
    id: string;                // Unique identifier
    content: string;           // Natural language content
    embedding: number[];       // Semantic vector representation
    creationTime: number;      // Timestamp of creation
    lastAccessTime: number;    // Timestamp of last access
}
```

Each SemanticAtom represents a piece of knowledge with both symbolic (content) and sub-symbolic (embedding)
representations, enabling the system to leverage both logical reasoning and semantic similarity.

### CognitiveItem

Contextualized thoughts with associated values that drive the cognitive processes:

```typescript
interface CognitiveItem {
    id: string;                // Unique identifier
    type: 'BELIEF' | 'GOAL' | 'QUERY'; // Item category
    label: string;             // Natural language representation
    truth?: TruthValue;        // Truth value for beliefs
    attention?: AttentionValue; // Attention value for goals
    meta?: Record<string, any>; // Metadata (domain, source, etc.)
}

interface TruthValue {
    frequency: number;         // Evidence frequency (0.0 to 1.0)
    confidence: number;        // Evidence amount (0.0 to 1.0)
}

interface AttentionValue {
    priority: number;          // Current importance (0.0 to 1.0)
    durability: number;        // Persistence of importance (0.0 to 1.0)
}
```

CognitiveItems represent the active elements in the system's reasoning process, each with specific types and values that
determine how they are processed.

## Cognitive Architecture

The system follows a modular architecture designed for self-reflection and adaptive reasoning, with each component
serving a specific role in the cognitive process:

### 1. Agenda System

The central cognitive queue that prioritizes processing tasks:

- **Priority-based Scheduling**: Items are processed based on their attention values
