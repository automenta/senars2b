## Overview

The Senars3 cognitive system implements a next-generation agentic reasoning framework based on Non-Axiomatic Logic (NAL)
principles. This approach fundamentally differs from traditional symbolic AI systems by replacing fixed axioms with
experience-grounded reasoning, enabling the system to handle uncertainty, learn from incomplete information, and adapt
its knowledge base through interaction with its environment.

The system combines symbolic reasoning with Language Model technology to create a system capable of learning,
adaptation, and self-improvement through interaction with its environment.

## Current Development Status

Senars3 is currently in active development with a focus on implementing a task-centric cognitive architecture. The
system has a working prototype with basic functionality but many advanced features are still being developed. See the
[Roadmap](#roadmap) section for details on current development priorities and future plans.

**Currently Implemented:**
- Basic cognitive architecture with agenda system and world model
- Task management system with factory and validation utilities
- Unified interface (CLI and Web) with WebSocket communication
- Community Simulator for multi-agent collaboration demonstrations
- Core reasoning components (perception, attention, resonance modules)

**In Development:**
- Advanced task processing and execution engine
- Schema learning and evolution mechanisms
- Enhanced uncertainty management
- Self-modification and metaprogramming capabilities

## Core Concepts

### Non-Axiomatic Logic Principles

Senars3 is built on four foundational principles of Non-Axiomatic Logic that enable adaptive, uncertainty-aware
reasoning:

#### 1. Experience-Grounded Reasoning

Unlike classical logic systems that rely on fixed axioms, NAL grounds all reasoning in experience. Every conclusion is
derived from observations and interactions rather than predetermined rules. This allows the system to:

- Adapt to new domains without reprogramming
- Handle incomplete or contradictory information gracefully
- Learn from both positive and negative examples
- Continuously refine its understanding through experience

#### 2. Uncertainty Management

All knowledge in the system carries explicit uncertainty measures through truth values:

- **Frequency (f)**: The relative frequency of evidence supporting a statement (0.0 to 1.0)
- **Confidence (c)**: The amount of evidence available (0.0 to 1.0)

These values allow the system to:

- Distinguish between well-supported beliefs and tentative hypotheses
- Make decisions based on available evidence even when incomplete
- Update beliefs as new evidence becomes available
- Reason about the reliability of its own conclusions

#### 3. Goal-Directed Cognition

All cognitive processes are driven by goals, which are represented as special types of cognitive items with attention
values:

- **Priority (p)**: The current importance of pursuing the goal (0.0 to 1.0)
- **Durability (d)**: How long the goal remains important (0.0 to 1.0)

This enables the system to:

- Focus computational resources on high-priority tasks
- Balance immediate needs with long-term objectives
- Adapt goal priorities based on changing circumstances
- Maintain coherent behavior across extended reasoning sessions

#### 4. Self-Reflective Operation

The system continuously monitors its own performance and adapts its reasoning processes:

- **Attention Mechanisms**: Dynamically allocate processing resources based on relevance
- **Resonance Processes**: Identify and strengthen coherent knowledge structures
- **Belief Revision**: Update knowledge based on new evidence and internal consistency
- **Schema Evolution**: Adapt reasoning patterns based on effectiveness

### Core Data Model

The Senars3 system uses two primary data structures to represent knowledge and cognitive states:

#### SemanticAtom

The fundamental unit of knowledge representation that combines natural language content with semantic embeddings:

```typescript
interface SemanticAtom {
    id: string;                // Unique identifier
    content: any;              // Natural language content or object
    embedding: number[];       // Semantic vector representation
    creationTime: number;      // Timestamp of creation
    lastAccessTime: number;    // Timestamp of last access
    meta: Record<string, any>; // Metadata
}
```

Each SemanticAtom represents a piece of knowledge with both symbolic (content) and sub-symbolic (embedding)
representations, enabling the system to leverage both logical reasoning and semantic similarity.

#### CognitiveItem

Contextualized thoughts with associated values that drive the cognitive processes:

```typescript
interface CognitiveItem {
    id: string;                // Unique identifier
    atom_id: string;           // Reference to SemanticAtom
    type: 'BELIEF' | 'GOAL' | 'QUERY' | 'EVENT' | 'TASK'; // Item category
    label: string;             // Natural language representation
    content?: any;             // Content of the item
    truth?: TruthValue;        // Truth value for beliefs
    attention: AttentionValue; // Attention value for goals
    meta?: Record<string, any>; // Metadata (domain, source, etc.)
    goal_parent_id?: string;   // Parent goal ID
    goal_status?: "active" | "blocked" | "achieved" | "failed";
    stamp: DerivationStamp;    // Derivation stamp
    payload?: Record<string, any>; // Payload for events/actions

    // Task-specific properties (only used when type is 'TASK')
    task_metadata?: TaskMetadata;
    
    // Task timestamps (only used when type is 'TASK')
    created_at?: number;       // Creation timestamp
    updated_at?: number;       // Last update timestamp
}

interface TruthValue {
    frequency: number;         // Evidence frequency (0.0 to 1.0)
    confidence: number;        // Evidence amount (0.0 to 1.0)
}

interface AttentionValue {
    priority: number;          // Current importance (0.0 to 1.0)
    durability: number;        // Persistence of importance (0.0 to 1.0)
}

// Task-specific metadata
export interface TaskMetadata {
    status: 'pending' | 'awaiting_dependencies' | 'decomposing' | 'awaiting_subtasks' | 
            'ready_for_execution' | 'completed' | 'failed' | 'deferred';
    priority_level: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high' | 'critical';
    dependencies?: string[]; // Array of task IDs
    deadline?: number; // Timestamp
    estimated_effort?: number;
    required_resources?: string[];
    outcomes?: string[];
    confidence?: number; // 0.0 to 1.0
    tags?: string[];
    categories?: string[];
    context?: Record<string, any>;
    completion_percentage?: number; // 0-100
    group_id?: string; // Identifier for grouping related tasks
    parent_id?: string; // Parent task ID
    subtasks?: string[]; // Subtask IDs
}
```

CognitiveItems represent the active elements in the system's reasoning process, each with specific types and values that
determine how they are processed. Tasks are represented as a special type of CognitiveItem with extended metadata.

## System Architecture

### Cognitive Architecture

The system follows a modular architecture designed for self-reflection and adaptive reasoning, with each component
serving a specific role in the cognitive process:

#### 1. Agenda System

The central cognitive queue that prioritizes processing tasks:

- **Priority-based Scheduling**: Items are processed based on their attention values
- **Dynamic Reordering**: Priorities are continuously updated based on system state
- **Resource Allocation**: Computational resources are allocated to high-priority items

The Agenda serves as the system's executive function, determining which cognitive tasks to process next based on their
importance and urgency.

#### 2. World Model

The persistent knowledge base with multi-indexed storage:

- **Semantic Indexing**: Content-based retrieval using semantic embeddings
- **Structural Indexing**: Relationship-based retrieval using logical connections
- **Temporal Indexing**: Time-based retrieval for episodic memory

The World Model maintains all knowledge and beliefs of the system, organized for efficient retrieval through multiple
access patterns.

#### 3. Cognitive Core

Worker pool for executing cognitive cycles with parallel processing capabilities:

- **Asynchronous Processing**: Non-blocking execution of cognitive tasks
- **Scalable Architecture**: Dynamically adjusts to workload demands
- **Verifiable Provenance**: Every derived item traces back to its source

The Cognitive Core executes the actual reasoning processes, applying various cognitive schemas to generate new
knowledge.

#### 4. Pluggable Cognitive Modules

Specialized components that handle specific cognitive functions:

- **AttentionModule**: Manages cognitive focus and resource allocation
- **ResonanceModule**: Identifies and strengthens coherent knowledge structures
- **SchemaMatcher**: Applies reasoning patterns to generate new knowledge
- **BeliefRevisionEngine**: Maintains knowledge consistency and updates beliefs
- **GoalTreeManager**: Manages complex goal hierarchies and decomposition
- **ReflectionLoop**: Enables self-monitoring and adaptation

#### 5. I/O Subsystems

Interface components for environmental interaction:

- **PerceptionSubsystem**: Converts natural language input into cognitive items
- **ActionSubsystem**: Executes actions and outputs responses

The I/O Subsystems provide the interface between the cognitive system and its environment, handling both input
processing and output generation.

### Core Components

The system is built around several core components that work together to enable cognitive reasoning:

- **Agenda System**: Central task queue that prioritizes processing based on attention values
- **World Model**: Persistent knowledge base that stores beliefs, goals, and queries
- **Cognitive Core**: Processing engine that executes reasoning cycles
- **Perception Subsystem**: Transforms inputs into cognitive items
- **Action Subsystem**: Generates outputs and executes actions

  -d '{"input": "My cat seems sick after eating chocolate. What should I do considering uncertainty?"}'
```

## Task Management System

The Senars3 system includes a powerful real-time task management system that integrates with the cognitive processing
engine. Tasks can be created, updated, and tracked through both the web interface and programmatic APIs.

### Universal Task Ontology

Tasks are the fundamental unit of cognition in Senars3. Every cognitive process—from simple perception to complex creative
synthesis—is represented as a structured task. This approach unifies all forms of reasoning under a single, intuitive
framework.

#### Core Task Structure

The task structure extends `CognitiveItem` with task-specific properties as defined in the data model above.

### Task Creation

Tasks can be created through the web interface or programmatically:

1. **Web Interface**: Use the "Task Management" tab to add new tasks with titles, descriptions, priorities, and due
   dates
2. **WebSocket API**: Send a request to the `tasks.addTask` method with task details
3. **REST API**: POST to the `/api/tasks` endpoint (when implemented)

### Task Properties

Each task includes the following properties:

- **Title**: A concise description of the task
- **Description**: Detailed information about the task (optional)
- **Priority**: A value between 0.0 and 1.0 indicating importance
- **Status**: One of the defined task statuses (`pending`, `awaiting_dependencies`, etc.)
- **Due Date**: Optional deadline for task completion
- **Dependencies**: Other tasks that must be completed before this task
- **Subtasks**: Tasks that are part of this larger task

### Task Processing

Tasks are automatically processed by the cognitive system based on:

1. **Priority**: Higher priority tasks are processed first
2. **Dependencies**: Tasks with unmet dependencies are queued until dependencies are completed
3. **Availability**: Tasks are converted to CognitiveItems when ready for processing

### Task Status Management

Task status can be updated through:

1. **Manual Updates**: Using the web interface or API calls
2. **Automatic Updates**: Based on cognitive processing results
3. **Dependency Resolution**: When dependent tasks are completed

### Integration with Cognitive Processing

Tasks are seamlessly integrated with the cognitive processing engine:

1. **Task-to-CognitiveItem Conversion**: Pending tasks are automatically converted to CognitiveItems
2. **Progress Tracking**: Task status is updated based on cognitive processing results
3. **Result Linking**: CognitiveItems generated from tasks are linked back to their originating tasks

### Current Task Features

- **Task Factory**: Utilities for creating standardized tasks with `createTask`, `createDerivedTask`, and `createSubtask`
- **Task Validation**: Validation and normalization utilities in `TaskValidator`
- **Hierarchical Tasks**: Support for parent-child relationships
- **Task Metadata**: Rich metadata including priority, dependencies, deadlines, and more

### Planned Task Features

- **Task Execution Engine**: Full execution capabilities for tasks
- **Automatic Progress Tracking**: Real-time progress calculation for hierarchical tasks
- **Task Grouping**: Grouping related tasks for better organization
- **Configurable Prioritization**: Advanced agenda algorithms for task prioritization
