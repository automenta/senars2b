# Senars3 Enhancement Strategy: Implementation Plan

## Vision
Transform Senars3 into a revolutionary cognitive operating system that redefines human-AI collaboration through a universal task-centric paradigm. This system will serve as foundational infrastructure for next-generation agentic assistants that think, learn, and adapt in fundamentally human-like ways while exceeding human capabilities in reasoning, knowledge integration, and problem-solving.

## Core Philosophy
Tasks are the fundamental unit of cognition. Every cognitive process—from simple perception to complex creative synthesis—is represented as a structured task. This approach unifies all forms of reasoning under a single, intuitive framework that makes artificial intelligence transparent, controllable, and infinitely extensible.

## Phase 1: Foundation - Task-Oriented Cognitive Core (Essential for MVP)

### 1. Universal Task Ontology Implementation
Priority: **CRITICAL**

#### Objective
Implement the Universal Task Ontology as the foundation for transforming Senars3 into a task-centric cognitive system.

#### Tasks to be Completed

##### 1.1 Define Core Task Structure (Extending CognitiveItem)
- Extend the `CognitiveItem` interface to include task-specific properties:
  ```typescript
  export interface CognitiveItem {
    // Existing properties...
    task_metadata?: {
      status: 'pending' | 'in_progress' | 'completed' | 'failed' | 'deferred';
      priority: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high' | 'critical';
      dependencies?: string[]; // Array of task IDs
      deadline?: number; // Timestamp
      estimated_effort?: number;
      required_resources?: string[];
      outcomes?: string[];
      confidence?: number; // 0.0 to 1.0
      tags?: string[];
      categories?: string[];
      context?: Record<string, any>;
    };
  }
  ```

##### 1.2 Implement Task Factory
Create new file with `TaskFactory` class:
  ```typescript
  import { CognitiveItem, AttentionValue, TruthValue } from '../interfaces/types';
  import { CognitiveItemFactory } from './cognitiveItemFactory';
  
  export class TaskFactory {
    static createTask(
      content: string,
      attention: AttentionValue,
      taskMetadata?: any
    ): CognitiveItem {
      // Implementation...
    }
    
    static createDerivedTask(
      parentIds: string[],
      content: string,
      attention: AttentionValue,
      taskMetadata?: any
    ): CognitiveItem {
      // Implementation...
    }
  }
  ```

##### 1.3 Add Task-Specific Metadata Fields
Add specific interfaces for task metadata:
  ```typescript
  export interface TaskMetadata {
    status: 'pending' | 'in_progress' | 'completed' | 'failed' | 'deferred';
    priority: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high' | 'critical';
    dependencies?: string[];
    deadline?: number;
    estimated_effort?: number;
    required_resources?: string[];
    outcomes?: string[];
    confidence?: number;
    tags?: string[];
    categories?: string[];
    context?: Record<string, any>;
  }
  ```

##### 1.4 Create Task Validation and Normalization Utilities
Create new file with validation functions:
  ```typescript
  import { CognitiveItem } from '../interfaces/types';
  
  export class TaskValidator {
    static validateTask(task: CognitiveItem): boolean {
      // Implementation...
    }
    
    static normalizeTask(task: CognitiveItem): CognitiveItem {
      // Implementation...
    }
  }
  ```

#### Implementation Steps

##### Step 1: Extend CognitiveItem Interface
1. Open `/src/interfaces/types.ts`
2. Add the `task_metadata` property to the `CognitiveItem` interface
3. Add the `TaskMetadata` interface

##### Step 2: Create TaskFactory
1. Create new file `/src/modules/taskFactory.ts`
2. Implement the `TaskFactory` class with methods for creating tasks
3. Ensure integration with existing `CognitiveItemFactory`

##### Step 3: Create TaskValidator
1. Create new file `/src/utils/taskValidator.ts`
2. Implement validation and normalization functions
3. Add error handling for invalid task structures

#### Integration Points
