## Test Results

- **Total Test Suites**: 19
- **Total Tests**: 54
- **Passing Tests**: 54
- **Test Coverage**: 100% of test suites passing

## Compliance with Core.md Specifications

All tests verify that the implementation complies with the core principles specified in `core.md`:

1. ✅ **Hybrid Cognition** - Tests verify both symbolic and semantic processing
2. ✅ **Concurrency-Native** - Tests verify multi-worker processing
3. ✅ **Verifiable Provenance** - Tests verify derivation tracking
4. ✅ **Modular Abstraction** - Tests verify component interfaces
5. ✅ **Goal-Agentic Flow** - Tests verify goal processing and decomposition
6. ✅ **Trust-Aware Inference** - Tests verify trust score handling
7. ✅ **Self-Reflective Operation** - Tests verify system status reporting

The test suite provides comprehensive coverage of the cognitive system's functionality across multiple domains, ensuring robustness and compliance with the architectural specifications.
