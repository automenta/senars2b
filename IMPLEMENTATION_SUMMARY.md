# Senars3 Cognitive System - Implementation Summary

This document summarizes the complete implementation of the Senars3 cognitive system according to the specifications in `core.md`.

## Core Principles Implementation

### ✅ Hybrid Cognition
- Implemented `SemanticAtom` for immutable knowledge with both symbolic content and semantic embeddings
- Implemented `CognitiveItem` for contextualized thoughts (beliefs, goals, queries)
- Combined symbolic logic with semantic vectors through multi-index querying
- Enhanced with cross-domain reasoning capabilities

### ✅ Concurrency-Native
- Implemented `DecentralizedCognitiveCore` with a worker pool model
- Used asynchronous processing throughout the system
- Thread-safe `PriorityAgenda` for concurrent access

### ✅ Verifiable Provenance
- Every `CognitiveItem` includes a `DerivationStamp` with timestamp, parent IDs, and schema ID
- Full traceability from derived items back to source atoms and reasoning rules
- Immutable data structures for atoms and derivation stamps

### ✅ Modular Abstraction
- All core cognitive functions encapsulated in swappable modules:
  - `AttentionModule`
  - `ResonanceModule`
  - `SchemaMatcher`
  - `BeliefRevisionEngine`
  - `GoalTreeManager`
  - `ReflectionLoop`
- Strict interfaces defined in `types.ts`
- Enhanced with pluggable enhanced components

### ✅ Goal-Agentic Flow
- All cognition driven by goals in the central `Agenda`
- Hierarchical goal decomposition and status tracking
- Goal-directed action execution through `ActionSubsystem`
- Extended with multi-criteria decision making schemas

### ✅ Trust-Aware Inference
- Knowledge sources weighted by credibility (`trust_score` in atom metadata)
- Confidence-weighted belief merging in `BeliefRevisionEngine`
- Source trust factored into attention calculations
- Enhanced with domain-specific trust dynamics

### ✅ Self-Reflective Operation
- Periodic KPI monitoring and system auditing in `ReflectionLoop`
- Contradiction detection and resolution
- Memory compaction and schema usage tracking
