# Frontend Code Improvements Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the comprehensive improvements made to the frontend codebase to enhance performance, accessibility, and user experience.

## Key Improvements

### 1. Performance Optimizations

#### Component Memoization
- Wrapped `TaskItem`, `TasksView`, and `TaskList` components with `React.memo`
- Prevents unnecessary re-renders when props haven't changed
- Results in smoother UI interactions, especially with large task lists

#### Efficient Data Processing
- Created `useTasks` hook to centralize task filtering and sorting logic
- Used `useMemo` to prevent recalculations on every render
- Optimized subtask calculation in `TaskItem` using `React.useMemo`

#### Virtual Scrolling Preparation
- Structured components to be compatible with virtual scrolling libraries
- Reduced DOM node count for better rendering performance

### 2. Accessibility Enhancements

#### Keyboard Navigation
- Implemented `useKeyboardNavigation` hook for consistent navigation
- Added support for arrow keys, Enter, and Escape key handling
- Improved focus management throughout the application

#### Screen Reader Support
- Created `a11yUtils` utility with screen reader announcement capabilities
- Added proper ARIA attributes to interactive elements
- Implemented focus management for modal dialogs and interactive components

#### Enhanced Semantics
- Improved HTML semantics for better assistive technology support
- Added proper labels and descriptions for all interactive elements

### 3. Code Organization

#### Custom Hooks
- `useTasks`: Centralized task filtering and sorting logic
- `useWebSocket`: Enhanced WebSocket connection with reconnection logic
- `useKeyboardNavigation`: Standardized keyboard navigation across components
- `useErrorHandler`: Consistent error handling patterns

#### Utility Functions
- `taskUtils`: Centralized task-related operations and formatting
- `dateUtils`: Standardized date formatting and manipulation
- `a11yUtils`: Accessibility-related utilities
- `perfUtils`: Performance monitoring utilities

#### TypeScript Improvements
- Enhanced typing in the store with better interfaces
- Added proper TypeScript interfaces for all components
- Improved type safety throughout the codebase

### 4. UI/UX Improvements

#### Notification System
- Enhanced `NotificationProvider` with:
  - Progress indicators
  - Manual dismissal capability
  - Hover to pause auto-dismiss
  - Better visual hierarchy
  - Additional notification types (warning)

#### Task Management
- Improved task editing with keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl+Enter to save, Esc to cancel)
- Better task status and priority display
- Enhanced progress bar visualization
- Improved subtask handling

#### Connection Handling
- Enhanced WebSocket connection with reconnection logic
- Better error handling and user feedback
- Connection status indicators with detailed error messages

### 5. Technical Improvements

#### Error Handling
- Added comprehensive error handling in WebSocket connections
- Created utility functions for consistent error messaging
- Improved error recovery mechanisms

#### Performance Monitoring
- Added utilities for measuring execution time
- Implemented component render performance monitoring
- Added memory usage tracking capabilities

#### Code Maintainability
- Better separation of concerns
- More modular code structure
- Reusable utility functions
- Consistent coding patterns
